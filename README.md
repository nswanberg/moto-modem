# what is this?

my internet connection flaked out.  comcast support is less helpful if you own your own modem.  the modem's interface sucks and doesn't retain logs, so i wrote all this to pull logs down from the modem's crappy soap interface and slice through the logs and connection info to see what's really happening.

if you have a motorola mb8600 and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and a crappy upstream connection to diagnose, boy howdy is this repo for you!

# Now works on Motorola MB8611

MB8611 uses https, but with a self-signed certificate...
